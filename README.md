# towerbirth

Capstone project for OSU

This is a tower defense game powered by the Phaser engine: http://phaser.io/

All art and sound assets were lifted under fair use from the Binding of Isaac series. This game is not meant for commercial use or release.

* I was the design and overall lead on the game, meaning that I did the following:

* Incorporated art and sound assets into the game

* Created levels and their designs

* Prototyped and produced the UI

* Created enemies and their AI, along with what they should do

* Created a basic goal: to protect the base while killing enemies

* Created items

* Animated sprites

* Led the team

The team consisted of three people total, myself included. The other two people worked on adding arithmetic programming logic to the various design concepts (e.g. tower logic, enemy pathing, enemies that can shoot, etc).

If you choose to pull this project, please note that you will have to run it via http-server or another localhost server. I recommend you do so regardless, as the release build online lacks a level skip ability, which I added in this debug version via the main menu.
